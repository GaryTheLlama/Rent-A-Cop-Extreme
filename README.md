==================

A reverse-stealth game made in 48 hours for a local game jam. (It won third place!)

This game was made for a 48 hour game jam although actual development time was far, far less. Probably about 10-12 hours including multiple scrapped prototypes. The theme was "stealth" which prompted me to avoid the typical trope of playing as a stealthy character. Instead you play a security guard that must watch a museum through CCTV monitors and try to identify a jewel thief based on them acting suspicious (i.e., stealthy).

I was responsible for all the programming, game design, and character sprites. In the beginning I had no artist so I did about half the level artwork, all of the character sprites, and defined the initial art style before I brought on an artist (Devon O'Mara; she knocked it out of the park!) to finish things up.

The code is pretty terrible, but that's fine because game jams aren't about beautiful code... They're about finishing a game! I have since rewritten all of the code in an effort to turn this prototype into an actual game, but that project is currently on hold.

The game ended up winning third place in the contest.

(Technologies used: ActionScript 3, FlashPunk, FlashDevelop, and Paint.NET.)
